# Docker Compose Override Example
# ================================
# 
# This file demonstrates how to override port bindings for local development.
# By default, services use 'expose' to avoid port conflicts during deployment.
# 
# To enable local access to services:
# 1. Copy this file to docker-compose.override.yml
# 2. Uncomment the services you need to access from your host machine
# 3. Run: docker compose up -d
#
# Docker Compose automatically merges docker-compose.yml with 
# docker-compose.override.yml if it exists.
#
# WARNING: Do NOT commit docker-compose.override.yml to version control!
# Add it to .gitignore to keep it local to your development environment.
