OK, so I want you to use to make the UI better, easier for researchers to actually use, but not to vibe code. You should want a black and white UI. I still want a lot of the research stuff. And I also want you to add more open source stuff. Search on the Internet for GitHub and things we could add in research papers or maybe research papers searching. Think of what other features that we could add. Just keep adding features each iteration. Each iteration should try to add a feature and make it better for researchers or just add a model or something.
